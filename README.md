## About

The Directory Comparison Tool is a simple Python script that allows you to compare the contents of two directories. It uses the file selection dialog from the `tkinter` module to let you choose the two directories to compare. Once you've selected the directories, the script will list the files that are unique to each directory.

## Features

- Compare the contents of two directories
- List the files that are unique to each directory

## Requirements

To run the Directory Comparison Tool, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Directory-Comparison-Tool.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the Directory Comparison Tool, run the `directory_comparison_tool.py` script: python directory_comparison_tool.py

The tool will display a welcome message and wait for you to press ENTER. After you've pressed ENTER, it will open two file selection dialogs, one for each directory you want to compare. Once you've selected the directories, the tool will display the files that are unique to each directory.
